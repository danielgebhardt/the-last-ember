# Player afflictions

The Disease slice is delivered in dependency order on `codex/disease-slice`. Balance defaults are provisional. Source enemies are enabled only after portable and sanctuary treatments and status guidance are available.

## Framework (#355)

Harmful non-poison player conditions have a separate typed lifecycle and a two-kind cap. Existing poison (six phases), buffs and monster controls remain in the existing timed-effect system. Application refreshes remaining duration, never potency; an existing lingering condition is a no-op. A third kind is rejected without replacing either active condition. Definitions describe target, lifetime, modifiers, cure and accessible guidance. Only Disease will be registered for this slice; the generic lifecycle tests use synthetic definitions rather than releasing other conditions.

The single committed-action boundary owns phase advancement. Application is phase one for temporary conditions; until-cured conditions never expire. Town, inspection, menus and rejected actions do not advance a phase. Stable kind ordering avoids source-order dependence. Existing poison damage remains before Renewal, and death stops recovery.
